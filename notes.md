* Configuring the API key URL
If anyone else is having 401 problems with the API data showing up, you need to sign up with openweathermap (the sign up option is all the way at the top), then get your own API key which should be in your new profile at openweathermap under the tab 'API Keys'.  Next, copy the key and go back to the URL for the forecast and replace the URL section after 'appid=' with your API key and remove the part for xml (remove this '&mode=xml') so it shows up as json instead.  And you can get a json formatter from the google chrome store named 'JSONView' by gildas, it will auto-unminify all json data that you look up in your browser.
